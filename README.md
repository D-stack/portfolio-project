# This is a header
# My name is Debra
## This is an even smaller header

### Even smaller...

###### Quite small

Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!

_This text is in italics._
I am Learning Visual Code
**This text is in bold.**
**Learning how to make things BOLD.**
**_This text is in both._**
**_Hopefully this is in both_**
~~This text is rendered with strikethrough.~~

Sometimes you want to embed some \*stylized text\*
right into **your paragraph.** Pretty cool, right!
