    <!-- Generally, you should only have 1 <h1> per page.
      Keep  your heading tags 'in order.'
    Never use heading tags just to 'style' your text-->
    <h1>This is a header</h1>
    <h2>This is an even smaller header</h2>
    <h3>Even smaller...</h3>
    <h6>Quite small</h6>
    <p>Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!</p>

    <p><em>This is an 'emphasis' tag that will usually render italicized.</em></p>

    <p><i>This text is in italics. We don't typically use this tag any longer. However, we would use it when we want to italicize WITHOUT giving additional emphasis. </i></p>

    <p><strong>This text is in bold.</strong></p>
    <p><b>This tag is just for making things written in bold as per some language arts.</b></p>



    <p><b>This text is in bold.</b></p>
    <p><b><i>This text is in both.</i></b></p>
    <p><del>This text is rendered with strikethrough.</del></p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to embed some <i>stylized text</i> right into <b>your paragraph.</b> Pretty cool, right!</p>
    <p>You could BREAK
      <!-- We should pretty much only use <br> when the line break is actually a part of th econtent - such as in a mailing address, or in a poem-->
